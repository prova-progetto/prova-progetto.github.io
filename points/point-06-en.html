                <h2>Historical context</h2>
                <p>
                    You are in Via Torquato Tasso 14, where today the “Eugenio Donadoni” middle school is located.
                    During the Italian Social Republic (1943–1945), this building was not a regular school: it housed
                    a unit of the GIL (Italian Youth of the Lictor) and the Female Auxiliary Service (SAF), a voluntary
                    female corps of the RSI.
                    <br><br>
                    The SAF was officially established by Decree no. 447 on April 18, 1944, in the period following
                    the Armistice of September 8, 1943, when Italy was divided between the Kingdom of the South,
                    aligned with the Allies, and the RSI, supported by Nazi Germany in the North.
                    <br><br>
                    The SAF counted about 130 volunteers, young Italian women aged between 18 and 40.
                    Its command was based in the Casa del Fascio, the local center of political and military
                    coordination, where duties were assigned and training courses were organized.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    SAF volunteers were motivated by loyalty to the regime, love for the homeland and a spirit of
                    adventure, but also by the desire to break away from traditional female roles.
                    They attended national and provincial training courses characterized by strict discipline and
                    military preparation, and carried out support duties such as cleaning, cooking, nursing,
                    clerical work and switchboard operations.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of the courses, they took an oath according to the formulas of the Republican armed
                    forces and, although they did not fight with weapons, they were considered militarized personnel
                    with the status of war volunteers.
                    <br><br>
                    Participation was significant: between May 1944 and April 1945, 5,771 applications were recorded,
                    with 1,016 auxiliaries active in July 1944 and a total of 4,412 volunteers before the corps was
                    dissolved.
                    The uniform included a long skirt, military jacket, beret with insignia, coat and long stockings,
                    while discipline required rigor, hierarchical respect and comradeship.
                    <br><br>
                    The SAF represented the fascist model of the “militant female citizen”: active in service to the
                    nation and loyal to the regime, yet confined to auxiliary roles and subordinate to male military
                    authority.
                </p>

                <div class="note">
                    In 1944, the provincial command of the Female Auxiliary Service in Bergamo presented the service
                    of auxiliaries as an act of discipline and sacrifice for the homeland.
                    A different perspective emerges from the testimony of a woman from Bergamo who served as an
                    auxiliary and later recalled: “In Bergamo they told us that serving as auxiliaries was an honor.
                    In reality, we did what the war no longer allowed men to do,” highlighting the subordinate role
                    assigned to them.
