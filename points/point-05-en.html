        <h2>Historical context</h2>

        <p>
          At 18 Torquato Tasso Street, where the “Giacomo e Pio Manzù” State Artistic High School is currently located, 
          there used to be a building that housed the offices of 
          <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup1">the Special Tribunal</span>
          for the Defense of the State.
        </p>

              <strong>Institution:</strong>
              Created in 1926 by the fascist regime after the so-called “fascist laws,” it became operational in 1927 to target political
              opponents and suppress democratic freedoms. It was abolished in 1943 and later re-established by the Italian Social 
              Republic until the Liberation.<br>
              <strong>Function:</strong>
              It judged so-called “political crimes,” including anti-fascist activities, the dissemination of underground press,
              membership in banned parties, and offenses against the regime. The defense of the State was synonymous with the 
              defense of fascism.<br>
              <strong>Composition and trials:</strong>
              It was largely composed of military personnel and regime members. Trials were swift, with few guarantees for 
              defendants and severe limitations on defense and appeal. Verdicts were often predetermined.<br>
              <strong>Punishments:</strong>
              It imposed prison sentences, internal exile, forced labor, and in some cases the death penalty. 
              The consequences often extended to the social and professional lives of the accused.<br>
              <strong>Historical significance:</strong>
              The Special Tribunal turned justice into a tool of political repression. Today it is remembered as a symbol 
              of the denial of the rule of law and a warning about the dangers of dictatorships.

          The Special Tribunal was established by the fascist regime on November 25, 1926, and began operating in 1927. 
          After an initial suppression in July 1943, it was re-established by the Italian Social Republic and remained operational 
          until the Liberation, with a branch also in Bergamo.

        <h2>The stabilization of the 1930s</h2>

        <p>
          In the 1930s, the Special Tribunal of Bergamo played a central role in stabilizing fascist justice, especially thanks to
          <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup2">the 1931 Extension Law</span>.
        </p>

              Its powers expanded: the tribunal was no longer limited to repressing anti-fascism, but became more broadly involved 
              in defending the personality of the State and the security of the regime.

        <p>
          Although it represented the judicial peak of political repression, the tribunal did not hold a monopoly in this area but operated 
          within a multi-centered system alongside the Ministry of the Interior, the police, the carabinieri, and the fascist party, with 
          frequent overlapping of responsibilities. Within this system, the Special Tribunal of Bergamo had a selective function: it judged 
          mainly the most serious and symbolically significant political crimes, while daily and preventive control remained with the other 
          bodies. In this way, it helped make political repression an ordinary and stable element of the fascist legal system, strengthening 
          the consolidation of the regime.

        <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>

        <p>
          The Special Tribunal represents one of the most repressive tools of the fascist dictatorship. Created after the introduction 
          of the “fascist laws,” it was used to target any form of political opposition, erasing fundamental freedoms such as freedom 
          of the press, association, and the right to strike.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trials were swift and lacked guarantees: the defendant often didn’t know the charges, couldn’t appeal, and could even 
          be sentenced to death. The verdicts were often pre-determined, making the tribunal a tool of fear and control.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          The Special Tribunal shows the true face of the dictatorship: a state that used the law not to guarantee justice, but to suppress dissent.

        <h2>Further insight: after the Liberation</h2>

        <p>
          After the fall of fascism and the end of World War II, places like this lost their repressive function. In the climate of 
          democratic reconstruction of the Italian Republic, the building was repurposed for educational use, becoming the headquarters 
          of the Artistic High School, founded in the early 1960s. The decision to transform a place linked to control and repression 
          into a school reflected the desire to return these spaces to the community and to affirm new values based on education, culture, 
          and freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subsequent naming of the school after Giacomo and Pio Manzù reinforces the symbolic meaning of this transformation: 
          from the headquarters of a tribunal that limited thought to a place dedicated to creativity and artistic expression. 
          Today, studying in that building means inhabiting a space that tells the story of Italy’s transition from dictatorship to 
          democracy, turning a place of repression into a place of formation and freedom.
