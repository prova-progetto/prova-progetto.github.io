        <h2>Historical context</h2>
        <p>
        Stumbling Stones (Stolpersteine) are an artistic and memorial project born in 1992 from the idea of the German artist Gunter Demnig, in response to the need to keep alive the memory of individual victims of National Socialism.
        </p>

        <p>
        Within a European context of processing the historical trauma of the Holocaust and political deportation, the initiative aims to restore an identity and a personal history to those whom the Nazi regime sought to annihilate, even erasing their names replaced by numbers in the extermination camps.
        </p>

        <p>
        The project, which has seen significant spread in Italy and in the province of Bergamo since 2016, is part of a broader, and somewhat delayed, process of diffused memory across the territory, aiming to fill the gaps in collective remembrance by focusing on the locations of the victims' daily lives.

        <h2>Why it is a site of memory</h2>

        <p>
        The Stumbling Stone dedicated to Aldo Ghezzi, like all Stolpersteine, transforms the pavement in front of the victim's last freely chosen home into a site of memory.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is not a celebratory monument in an exceptional space, but a discreet sign integrated into the everyday urban fabric, which symbolically forces those who accidentally walk over it to reflect. The plaque, by recalling the name, biographical details, and tragic fate of Aldo Ghezzi from partisan in the "Garibaldi" Brigade to a deportee who perished from deprivation in Ebensee restores dignity to his individuality, opposing the logic of the anonymous annihilation of the concentration camp.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this way, memory becomes an act both intimate and collective, which rescues personal history from oblivion and turns public space into a permanent reminder of the extreme consequences of political and racial oppression.
        </p>
