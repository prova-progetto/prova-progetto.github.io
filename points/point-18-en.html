                <p>
                    You are in Via Pignolo 10. During the Nazi-Fascist occupation, this corner of Bergamo represented
                    an invisible boundary between everyday life and terror. Just a few steps from here was the
                    headquarters of the GNR (National Republican Guard), the police force of the Fascist regime,
                    composed of Italians who chose to collaborate with the German occupiers.
                    <br><br>
                    Their units were notorious for the brutality with which they hunted down partisans and for the
                    torture inflicted in the basements of the nearby barracks in Via Francesco Nullo.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    Right here, on February 8, 1945, the life of a seventeen-year-old boy came to a halt.
                    Ferruccio Dell'Orto, a student at the Vittorio Emanuele Institute (codename “Marco”),
                    was standing exactly where you are now during an extremely dangerous mission: disarming a
                    Fascist officer in order to seize his weapons.
                    <br><br>
                    A gunfight broke out. Ferruccio was shot in the leg and fell to the ground.
                    Instead of receiving medical treatment, he was dragged by GNR militiamen to the nearby barracks.
                    Despite bleeding heavily and being subjected to inhuman torture, Ferruccio chose absolute silence.
                    He died that same evening within those walls, less than one hundred meters from where you now
                    stand, without betraying a single name of his comrades.
                </p>

                <div class="note">
                    Ferruccio’s silence has remained etched into the stones of this street.
                    A witness of the time recalled: “He was little more than a child, yet he showed the courage of a
                    giant in front of his tormentors.”
                    <br><br>
                    In the official motivation for his commemorative medal, it is stated:
                    “Captured and wounded, he endured atrocious torture without revealing anything.”
                    Today, number 10 is no longer just an address, but the place where an adolescent decided that
                    the freedom of others was worth more than his own life.
