                <h2>Historical context</h2>
                <p>
                    We are now in the heart of the lower city, a space that took on a central role in Bergamo’s urban
                    development
                    and public life during the twentieth century. At the beginning of the century, in fact, based on a
                    project
                    by architect Marcello Piacentini, city life gradually began to shift from the upper city toward the
                    area
                    where we are today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The square acquired a strong symbolic and civic value, becoming a privileged place for celebrations,
                    demonstrations, and moments of public gathering. Starting in 1921, it was officially named after
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup1">Vittorio Veneto</span>,
                    taking on the meaning of a space dedicated to the memory of Bergamo’s fallen soldiers of the First
                    World War
                    and becoming an important place of collective memory.

                        which marked
                        Italy’s final victory over the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the First World War. This event was
                        considered
                        decisive for the end of the conflict and became a symbol of sacrifice, heroism, and national
                        unity.

                <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    On 27 October 1924, a date linked to the anniversary of the March on Rome, Benito Mussolini
                    inaugurated the
                    tower that still dominates the square today, transforming it into a true celebratory monument of the
                    regime.
                    During the inauguration, speeches were given, in addition to the Duce himself, by Antonio Locatelli
                    and
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup2">Giacomo Suardo</span>,
                    leading figures of local and national fascism. In 1936, following the defeat in East Africa, the
                    names of
                    eight fallen soldiers were engraved on the tower, among whom also appears that of
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup3">Locatelli</span>,
                    further strengthening the link between the monument and the fascist rhetoric of sacrifice and
                    heroism.

                            Giacomo Suardo was one of the main figures of fascism in Bergamo. He held the role of local
                            secretary of the
                            National Fascist Party and was also a member of parliament, representing the connection
                            between local and
                            national fascist power.

                <p>
                    However, the meaning of the tower and the square changed over time, especially after 8 September
                    1943.
                    Following the attempt at antifascist liberation, speeches were delivered from the tower by
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup4">Ernesto Rossi</span>,
                    Luigi Bruno, and Mario Mammuccari, symbolically marking a break with the former regime. Two months
                    later, a
                    group of women decided to express their dissent toward the Nazi-Fascists through a simple but highly
                    symbolic
                    gesture: placing and throwing flowers at the base of the tower. After the liberation between 25 and
                    28 April
                    1945, partisan formations, instead of speaking from the tower’s balcony as the Duce had done,
                    consciously
                    chose to set up a raised stage in the square, positioning themselves almost at the same level as the
                    people.
                    This gesture emphasized the desire to break with the regime’s authoritarian rhetoric and to affirm a
                    new
                    relationship between citizens and power, based on participation and closeness.

                    a group of women from Bergamo carried out a symbolic act of great courage and protest against the
                    fascist
                    regime. The women – including Adriana De Leidi,
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="d1">Mary Tadini Leidi</span>,

                    The police attempted to prevent the laying of flowers by protecting the tower; the women responded
                    with
                    determination, throwing the flowers over the heads of the officers, thus transforming a
                    commemorative act
                    into a public and symbolic act of dissent against the fascist regime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following year, the same gesture was repeated thanks to the organization of the Italian
                    Communist Party
                    (PCI), demonstrating how women’s protest in Bergamo had become part of a broader antifascist
                    movement in the
                    city.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To commemorate this important episode, which unites the memory of the fallen with civil resistance,
                    Bergamo
                    placed a commemorative plaque inside the tower in Piazza Vittorio Veneto, allowing citizens and
                    visitors
                    today to learn about the courage of those women who openly challenged fascist authority with a
                    simple but
                    powerful gesture.
