        <h2>Historical and architectural context</h2>
        <p>The Palazzo della Libertà, located in Piazza della Libertà in Lower Bergamo, was built between 1937 and 1940 based on a design by Alziro Bergonzo as the "Casa del Fascio," the local headquarters of the National Fascist Party (PNF). It was part of the fascist plan for the monumental redevelopment of the city: to create the new square, the San Marco hospital was demolished. The inauguration of the square in 1939, on the anniversary of the March on Rome, highlights the building's propagandistic role, conceived as a political center and a symbol of local fascist power. After 1945 it was renamed Palazzo della Libertà (Palace of Liberty), marking the transition from dictatorship to democracy.</p>
        <p>The building features a rationalist and monumental style, typical of fascist architecture. The facade is characterized by a large portico with twelve pillars and cladding in Zandobbio marble, which conveys solemnity and authority. The palace is designed in close relationship with the square, which enhances its function as an urban and political hub.</p>

        <h2>Why it is a site of memory</h2>
        <p>The Palazzo della Libertà is a place of memory because it materially testifies to the power of the fascist regime and its use of architecture as a propaganda tool. At the same time, the change of name and function after the Liberation transformed its meaning, making it a symbol of democratic rebirth. Today it invites reflection on the relationship between architecture, power, and historical memory.</p>
