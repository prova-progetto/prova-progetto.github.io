                <h2>Historical context</h2>
                <p>
                    Reaching Piazza Giacomo Matteotti, we come across the town hall building known as Palazzo Frizzoni.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This building, a symbol of municipal power, became the official seat of the city administration on
                    October 28, 1928 (the anniversary of the
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup1">March on Rome</span>
                    ), replacing the former town hall located at Via T. Tasso, 4. The choice of this date was not
                    accidental:
                    October 28, 1928 marked the celebration of Mussolini’s rise to power and of the fascist regime, and
                    represented a moment of consolidation of central government control over local administrations.
                    Palazzo Frizzoni thus became the symbolic place of fascist power in the city. At the head of the
                    municipal
                    administration was the podestà, a figure who replaced the mayor, and one of the most well-known
                    podestàs
                    of that period was Antonio Locatelli, who held the office during those years.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    From February 4, 1926, all the functions of mayor, municipal executive committee, and city council
                    were
                    centralized and assigned to the podestà, a figure inspired by medieval models of centralized
                    government,
                    admired by Mussolini and reinterpreted as instruments of autocracy and control. This reform gave the
                    podestà exclusive power to appoint and manage municipal offices, eliminating all forms of popular
                    participation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The podestà remained in office for a period of five years, but a subsequent fascist law established
                    that
                    only married men could hold this position, excluding Antonio Locatelli from the possibility of
                    continuing
                    his mandate. This episode represents an emblematic example of the punitive and rigid regulations
                    imposed
                    by fascism, which set not only political but also social and personal rules, within a logic of total
                    control over private lives. Palazzo Frizzoni thus stands as a witness to an era in which local
                    autonomy
                    was replaced by the fascist dictatorship.

                <h2>In-depth – Antonio Locatelli</h2>
                <p>
                    Antonio Locatelli was born in 1895 and took part in the First World War as an aviator,
                    distinguishing
                    himself for his courage and flying skills. The war experience deeply marked his life and helped
                    strengthen his bond with nationalist ideology, which in the following years led him to
                    enthusiastically
                    embrace fascism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the rise of the fascist regime, Locatelli began a political career: between 1924 and 1928 he
                    was
                    elected as a deputy to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1933 he began his activity in
                    Bergamo
                    by taking on the role of podestà. However, his mandate lasted only one year: in 1934, following a
                    law
                    wanted by Mussolini that prevented unmarried men from holding public office, Locatelli was forced to
                    leave the position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On January 7, 1936, he volunteered for the war in Ethiopia, taking part in military operations as an
                    aircraft pilot. During the conflict, despite the technological and military superiority of the
                    Italian
                    army, Ethiopian forces managed to organize effective resistance actions. On a night in June 1936,
                    the
                    Ethiopians attacked an Italian airfield, setting the aircraft on fire: all the soldiers present were
                    killed in the attack, including Antonio Locatelli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His death was immediately celebrated by the regime as a heroic sacrifice. In Bergamo, a true cult of
                    the hero developed, fueled by fascist propaganda, which presented Locatelli as a symbol of courage,
                    dedication to the homeland, and loyalty to fascism. Even today, in the tower located in Piazza
                    Vittorio
                    Veneto, Antonio Locatelli is remembered through a sculpted portrait, a testimony to historical
                    memory
                    and to the significance his figure had for the city.

                <h2>In-depth – The myth of Ancient Rome in fascist rhetoric</h2>
                <p>
                    The myth of Ancient Rome represented one of the most powerful ideological tools through which the
                    fascist regime sought to legitimize its political and imperial project. The very term “podestà”
                    refers
                    to a medieval office, in which an external magistrate, elected annually, governed the communes by
                    holding executive, judicial, and military powers in order to ensure impartiality and order,
                    replacing
                    the consuls. Roman heritage was not presented as a simple cultural legacy, but as the natural
                    destiny of
                    the nation, called upon to reaffirm its dominance in the Mediterranean and in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This operation directly involved the educational system. From the 1930s onward, schools became a
                    central tool of indoctrination: Roman history was used as a pretext to exalt the imperial values of
                    fascism, while a Roman-centered vision gave way to an openly Italy-centered perspective, in which
                    fascist Italy appeared as the legitimate heir of the Roman Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reference to Roman heritage was also intertwined with the regime’s colonial and demographic
                    project.
                    The idea of the Empire, supported by the rhetoric of the “civilizing mission,” justified both the
                    conquest of African colonies and the need to shape a “new Italian,” disciplined, loyal, and ready
                    for
                    sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through schools, families, mass media, and public space, the regime thus built an imaginary world in
                    which Ancient Rome, fascism, and the colonial empire appeared as a single entity.
