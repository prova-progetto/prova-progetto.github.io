        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
          We are at the railway station of Bergamo, a crucial hub during the Nazi-Fascist occupation (1943-1945). This place, like many other Italian stations, was the stage for one of the most tragic events of the Resistance: from here, cattle cars departed, deporting to Nazi concentration camps about 900 people, mostly workers and political opponents. The deportation followed the general strikes of March 1944, a massive workers' mobilization in Northern Italy to demand better living conditions and to oppose the Italian Social Republic and the German occupiers. The strikers, aware of the risk of arrest and deportation, defied the regime, suffering fierce repression. The transports were often organized from stations like this one, where deportees were crammed in inhumane conditions for a journey into the unknown, marked by hunger, cold, and fear.

        <h2>Why it is a Place of Memory</h2>
        <p>
          This station is a place of memory because it materializes the passage from the struggle for dignity in work to the tragedy of deportation. It is not just a geographical point of departure, but a symbol of the violence suffered by a civilian community that chose to resist. Remembering the 900 deportees here means honoring their sacrifice and keeping alive the awareness of the values they fought for: freedom, social justice, and human dignity against oppression. The plaque speaks of a civic duty that goes beyond history: "We must not shoot anyone, we must set an example," as a survivor recalled, emphasizing how from suffering emerged a choice for justice and not vengeance. In an era where rights and democracy may seem taken for granted, this place questions us about the price that was paid for them and the importance of defending them every day.
