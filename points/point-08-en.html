        <h2>Historical context</h2>
        <p>
          During the twenty years of Fascist rule (1922–1943), the Italian press was progressively stripped of its freedom of expression and transformed into an instrument of political propaganda. Benito Mussolini's regime understood the importance of newspapers in controlling public opinion and introduced severe laws to limit informational pluralism.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the 1926 press law, every newspaper was required to have an editor-in-chief approved by the State and was subject to prior censorship. News was controlled daily through official directives, often issued by the Ministry of Popular Culture, which dictated what to publish and what to omit.
        </p>

        <p>
          The press in Bergamo also suffered these restrictions. Local newspapers were subjected to political and institutional pressures, adapting their content to the regime's demands. After the fall of Fascism on 25 July 1943, and following the 8 September 1943 armistice, the local press reflected the rapid and dramatic political changes experienced by Italy during that period.

        <h2>Why it is a site of memory</h2>

        <p>
        The building that now houses the Ciro Caversazzi Library, at 4 Via Torquato Tasso, is a site of great historical value because it was directly involved in the history of Bergamo's press during the Second World War.
        </p>

        <p>
        After 25 July 1943, with the fall of the Fascist regime, the building became the headquarters of the daily newspaper La Voce di Bergamo, the organ of the Inter-party Committee, directed by Alfonso Vajani, representing the transitional phase following Fascism.          
        </p>

        <p>
        After 8 September 1943, with the German occupation and the establishment of the Italian Social Republic, the same building housed the newspaper Bergamo Repubblicana, the daily paper of the Republican Fascist Party.
        </p>

        <p>
        This site is therefore historical because it represents a concrete point where propaganda, censorship, and political changes intersect, showing how the press was used as an instrument of power and control during one of the most complex periods in Italian history.
