                <p>
                    Via Pignolo 13 was not just an address, but one of the operational centers of the Resistance in
                    Bergamo. In these buildings, among hidden courtyards and basements, the lives of those who had
                    chosen to rebel against the regime intersected.
                    <br><br>
                    After September 8, 1943, the city became a labyrinth of spies and informants: a single whispered
                    word to the wrong person could lead to arrest by the Fascist Federal Police, whose offices were
                    located just a few steps from here.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    The Turani Group takes its name from brothers Aurelio and Luigi Turani.
                    It was a young and highly dynamic action group operating right here, in the heart of Via Pignolo.
                    Their mission was vital: recovering weapons, distributing underground press, and organizing
                    connections with partisan units in the mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    Their downfall was caused by betrayal. An infiltrator managed to gain their trust, leading to the
                    arrest of the group members between late 1944 and early 1945.
                    Many were taken to the Sant’Agata prison or directly to the barracks in Via Nullo.
                    Aurelio Turani, after being tortured, was deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp, from which
                    he never returned.
                    <br><br>
                    The group was dismantled, but their sacrifice helped protect other Resistance cells in the city,
                    which survived until Liberation.
                </p>

                <div class="note">
                    The fate of the Turani Group is summed up in the words written by survivors:
                    “Betrayal broke our ranks, but it did not extinguish the idea.”
                    <br><br>
                    Walking today in front of number 13, one can still hear the warning of those who lived through
                    those days: “Freedom is like air: you only realize its value when it begins to be lacking.”
                    Remembering the Turani brothers means honoring those who, in a climate of total suspicion,
                    chose to trust their comrades until the ultimate sacrifice.
