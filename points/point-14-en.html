        <h2>Historical context</h2>
        <p>
          The Baroni College, located at 123 Via Pignolo and now home to the University of Bergamo, was established at the end of the nineteenth 
          century as an elementary school with an attached boarding facility, founded by Professor Angelo Baroni. It later became a boarding school 
          for the Royal Technical Industrial Institute, hosting students from across the province.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the German occupation, on 3 October 1943, the building was requisitioned and converted into the headquarters of the German Gendarmerie 
          and into a political prison.

        <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1943 and 1945, the Baroni College was one of the main sites of Nazi repression in Bergamo. Here, anti-fascists and partisans 
          accused of crimes against German authority were imprisoned and interrogated, before being transferred to the Sant’Agata prison or to 
          the Matris Domini monastery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous testimonies describe extremely harsh interrogations and inhuman torture. Don Mario Benigni was subjected to violence for days, 
          while other prisoners were brutally killed. This building is a symbol of the violence of the Nazi occupation and of the sacrifice of 
          those who fought for freedom.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          «In this boarding school, violently occupied in the years 1943–1945, the Nazi police raged against our finest brothers: freedom took 
          root thanks to their sacrifice».

        <h2>In-depth study: transfer of prisoners and testimonies</h2>

        <p>
          According to some testimonies, in <strong> January 1944 </strong> the SS guards stationed at the Baroni College were recalled to the front, and the 
          building was emptied of prisoners during the night of the 21st. At least five witnesses — <em> Franco Maj, Cesare Bonino, Giovan Battista 
          Cortinovis, Luigi Mondini, Giacomo Paganoni </em> — recount what happened that night.
        </p>

        <p>
          The prisoners, according to Cesare Bonino a total of 56 under the custody of about ten SS men, were taken out into the courtyard under the watchful 
          eyes of their worried guards, as noted by Cortinovis, and transferred to the Sant’Agata prison, where a German garrison had been installed since 
          December 1943.
        </p>

        <p>
          This did not mean the definitive closure of the Baroni: as late as March 1944, captured partisans were still taken there, such as Adriana 
          Locatelli and some of her companions from the Maresana group. It is likely that the very limited German staff was supported by Fascist personnel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cross-referencing the testimonies reveals an increasingly efficient organization of the Fascist repressive apparatus, in which figures 
          such as Resmini, Strohmenger, Monge, Ghisleni, Zanchi, and Messaggi emerge, working in complete synergy with the Nazi authorities.
