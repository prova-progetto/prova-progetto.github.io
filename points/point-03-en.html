        <h2>Historical context</h2>
        <p>The "Lussana" High School building came into being during the peak of the Fascist regime, which made controlling the education and leisure time of young people a fundamental pillar of its totalitarian project.</p>
        <p>The school system, reformed in 1923 by Gentile along selective and hierarchical lines, became the primary instrument for shaping consciousness, while parallel organisations such as the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB) and the Gioventù Italiana del Littorio (GIL) aimed to occupy every aspect of life from sports to collective rituals in order to create an identity entirely absorbed by the regime's ideology.</p>
        <p>The building on Via Angelo Maj, inaugurated in 1932 and designed by the Rationalist architect Alziro Bergonzo, was conceived precisely as the monumental home of this comprehensive education a physical symbol of the Fascist will to mould new generations through discipline, militarisation, and indoctrination.</p>

        <h2>Why it is a site of memory</h2>
        <p>Lussana High School is a site of memory because its building physically and symbolically preserves the layered traces of that past.</p>
        <p>The austere architecture, the plaques (such as the one dedicated to Sandro Italico Mussolini), the Fascist symbols still visible on its façade, and the inscriptions in its basements which testify to the use of these spaces as changing rooms, but also as a detention site during the Italian Social Republic are all material documents of a project that used education to subjugate, not to emancipate.
        Today, as the home of a public republican school, this space transforms into a permanent invitation to critical reflection.</p>
        <p>Its history compels us to question the dangers of educational manipulation and, at the same time, champions the principles of liberty and democracy enshrined in the Constitution. This makes remembrance an active exercise in conscious citizenship.</p>
