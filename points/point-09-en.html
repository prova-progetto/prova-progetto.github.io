                            Public bodies responsible for managing the hiring of workers. During fascism, they became
                            tools of
                            political control, through which the regime decided who was allowed to work.

                    ), these offices took on a central role in strengthening fascist control over the country’s economic
                    and
                    social life. Several offices were established here to manage and allocate labor, with the aim of
                    ensuring
                    that hiring followed fascist criteria and that workers were aligned with the ideals of the regime.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    Fascist control over workplaces was not limited to bureaucratic organization, but also resulted in
                    discrimination against those who did not follow the regime. Starting on March 29, 1928, fascism
                    began to
                    intervene directly in workplaces through a
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup3">Royal Decree</span>,
                    which established that hiring should give priority to those holding a
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup4">membership card</span>
                    of the National Fascist Party (PNF). The law not only imposed ideological selection, but also helped
                    exclude
                    from employment those who were not loyal to the regime.

                <h2>In-depth – The General Labour Inspectorate</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the employment offices, the General Labour Inspectorate also operated in this area,
                    an
                    institution established and managed by the Italian Social Republic. This body mainly had two tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first was to replace
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup5">conscripted</span>
                    workers with so-called volunteer workers. The Inspectorate sought to limit the direct use of
                    <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup6">coercion</span>
                    by offering “voluntary” labor in place of requisitioned labor. However, this voluntariness was often
                    only
                    apparent, as many accepted out of necessity, fear of reprisals, or to avoid deportation.
                </p>
                <div class="popup-box" id="popup5">
                    <div class="popup-content">
                        <p>
                            German authorities imposed conscription, meaning the obligation to report for forced labor,
                            with no
                            possibility of refusal.
                        </p>
                        <button class="popup-close">Close</button>

                <div class="popup-box" id="popup6">
                    <div class="popup-content">
                        <p>
                            Constraint or oppression that forces someone to act against their own will.
                        </p>
                        <button class="popup-close">Close</button>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The second objective was direct cooperation with German authorities for the execution of
                    infrastructural
                    and strategic works, such as the construction and repair of roads, bridges, and railways, as well as
                    other
                    civil and military projects essential to the war effort and territorial control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this context, the Organisation Todt was also active, a German organization responsible for major
                    military and infrastructural works in occupied territories during the war. In the province of
                    Bergamo,
                    Todt conscripted 6,848 workers, but only 146 actually reported for duty; of these, 13 were sent to
                    work in
                    Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The harshness of repression is still remembered today by a plaque located in Via Porta Dipinta, in
                    Bergamo, commemorating five citizens from Bergamo who were executed in Pesaro, victims of violence
                    and
                    reprisals linked to the system of occupation and collaboration.
