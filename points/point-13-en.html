        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
            We are at the Matris Domini Monastery in Bergamo, a place of cloister transformed into a Nazi military prison in the spring of 1944. During the German occupation (1943-1945), the SS requisitioned part of the convent, confined the nuns, and set up cells for prisoners awaiting trial or deportation. Among others, Don Agostino Vismara was imprisoned here, a military chaplain unjustly accused of arms trafficking for the Resistance. The monastery became a place of detention but also of silent resistance: from nearby houses, such as that of the Leidi family, signals of comfort and hope were sent to the prisoners by waving flags to communicate news. This place symbolizes the dual nature of the occupation: the violence of Nazi-Fascist arbitrariness and the tenacious network of civil and religious solidarity that tried to oppose it.

        <h2>Why it is a Place of Memory</h2>
        <p>
            The Matris Domini Monastery is a place of memory because it embodies the forced transformation of a space of spirituality into one of repression, while still maintaining a subtle human resistance. Remembering this place means honoring not only the suffering of the detainees but also the courage of a community that, even under occupation, found ways to support the prisoners with gestures of extraordinary solidarity, such as signals from the windows. The story of Don Vismara, suspended between the hope of a trial never held and the constant threat of deportation, speaks to us about the arbitrariness of power and the vulnerability of rights. Today, this site reminds us how, even in the darkest moments, human dignity can be defended with silent support and the cohesion of a community, fundamental values for a civil and democratic society.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            "From the way the cloth was waved from the Leidi tower [...] reasons for good news were drawn."* – This gesture of passive resistance, a signal of hope from above, encapsulates the spirit of resilience that permeated those walls.

        <h2>Don Agostino Vismara at Matris Domini</h2>
        <p>
          In May 1944, Don Agostino Vismara was transferred to the German prison of Matris Domini in Bergamo, where he was detained under German control awaiting a trial that would never take place. His imprisonment occurred in a context of suspended legality and intense political repression.

          <br> The documentation preserves traces of censored correspondence, translated into German by the authorities, and letters smuggled out of the prison, signs of attempts to maintain contact with the outside. There are also self-defense notes written while awaiting trial.

          <br> After Matris Domini, Vismara was transferred to San Vittore and subsequently deported to the Mauthausen and Dachau camps. The Matris Domini prison thus represents a decisive stage in the journey from detention to deportation.
