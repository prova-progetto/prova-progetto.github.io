                <h2>Historical context</h2>
                <p>
                    We are standing in front of the historic headquarters of the Vittorio Emanuele II Technical
                    Institute. During the Fascist period, this building was not only a place of education, but also a
                    center of surveillance and control. The most radical transformation occurred during the Nazi
                    occupation (1943–1945): the building was seized by German forces and turned into a strategic
                    military
                    headquarters. Because of the occupation, educational activities were suspended and the school was
                    forced to relocate, leaving these classrooms under military control until Liberation.

                <h2>Why this is a place of memory</h2>
                <p>
                    Ernesto Rossi turned his economics lectures at Vittorio Emanuele into a form of political
                    resistance.
                    A leader of the Justice and Freedom movement, he used Bergamo as a strategic hub to connect internal
                    resistance with anti-fascist forces in exile. He paid for this courage with his arrest in 1930 and
                    thirteen years of imprisonment, during which he contributed to the drafting of the Ventotene
                    Manifesto, laying the foundations for a united Europe.
                    <br><br>
                    Ada Rossi, a scientist and fiercely independent woman, was a key figure in the city’s civil
                    resistance. Dismissed from her job by the regime, she never stopped fighting: through private
                    lessons, she educated dozens of young people in democratic values, preparing the ground for the
                    future local Resistance. Acting as a silent courier, she helped smuggle out of confinement the
                    writings that would shape European identity.
                    <br><br>
                    Together, Ernesto and Ada Rossi demonstrated that freedom is defended both through political action
                    and the education of younger generations.
                </p>

                <div class="note">
                    The more than 900 letters exchanged during imprisonment were not merely personal messages, but real
                    instruments of resistance. Ada secretly read them to her students to educate them in freedom:
                    “In Bergamo, thirty people read them and are amazed by your courage.” In those writings, Ernesto
                    insisted that “no defeat is final as long as one refuses to accept it,” transforming the suffering
                    of imprisonment into a shared civic consciousness for the entire city.
