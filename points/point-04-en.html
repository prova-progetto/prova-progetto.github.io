        <h2>Historical context</h2>

        <p>
          We are at Via Gallicciolli 3, in Bergamo, today the headquarters of
          <span class="popup-trigger" data-popup="popup1">Credito Bergamasco</span>.
        </p>

        <div class="popup-box" id="popup1">

            <p>
              The origins of the building date back to 1427, when the Franciscan Friars built the convent and 
              the church dedicated to Santa Maria delle Grazie. Over the centuries, the structure underwent several 
              transformations: it became a shelter for the poor and, during the First World War, a military hospital, 
              before becoming the headquarters of a banking institute in 1928.
              In 1962 the building was renovated and decorated with frescoes, mosaics, and sculptures by major Bergamo artists. 
              In 2011, conservation work was carried out on the façade and the square was redeveloped, where the large sculpture 
              *Anima Mundi*, commissioned by the Creberg Foundation and created by Ugo Riva, was installed.

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          During the Italian Social Republic, the building housed the Dante Alighieri College, which was transformed into a 
          barracks of the notorious Public Order Company (OP) of the Republican National Guard.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between 1943 and 1945, the units operating here were involved in the repression of anti-fascist opposition and were 
          responsible for interrogations, beatings, and torture inflicted on partisans and political opponents.

        <h2>Why it is a place of memory</h2>

        <p>
          This site is a symbol of the violence exercised by the fascist regime against all forms of dissent. Within these 
          walls, many people were detained and tortured for the sole “crime” of having defended freedom and democracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stone plaque, placed on 27 May 1962 by the Association of Italian Anti-Fascist Political Persecutees, 
          commemorates the sacrifice of those who opposed fascist torture with the strength of their ideals and human dignity.

        <h2>In-depth section – The OP Company and the Cornalba massacre</h2>

        <p>
          The Public Order Company of the Republican National Guard operating from this site did not limit itself to urban 
          repression, but was also involved in military operations and round-ups throughout the province of Bergamo.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most serious episodes was the Cornalba massacre, which took place on 25 November 1944, when fascist units 
          killed fifteen partisans in the Upper Brembana Valley, as part of the anti-partisan repression of the Italian Social Republic.
        </p>

        <p>
          This connection shows how the violence exercised within these walls was part of a broader repressive system that 
          struck opponents and civilians across the province.

        <h2>In-depth section – Testimonies</h2>

        <p>
          Torture was routinely practiced in the premises of Via Gallicciolli. There are many harrowing testimonies given after 
          the war; among them, those of Giuseppe Emilio Farina, Vittorio Castelli, Cristoforo Pezzini, Mario Invernicci, and 
          Arialdo Banfi deserve particular mention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Banfi’s testimony, in particular, fully conveys the tragic extent of the fragility of the human body and the blindness 
          of the violence inflicted there, which was opposed through the deep solidarity among partisans and their shared 
          belief in a future founded on truth and freedom.
